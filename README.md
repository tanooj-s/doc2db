# doc2db
Project for NSE, running pretrained DistilBERT as a kind of chatbot on corporate documents to return results as JSON and then use the driver to push the JSON file to a (local) Neo4j instance.
Would probably be best to run the model on Colab, then download the .json file and run the other script. 
Work in progress, would like to have the whole thing be automated, but it depends on the data model being finalized.
